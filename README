A little script to convert a directory of numbered images to a pdf.

Files need to be named 1.xxx, 2.xxx, 3.xxx ... 123.xxx, without leading zeroes.
The script will batch rename files, so expect them to change.

At the moment there needs to be no leading zeroes on file names.

Then it converts all files to pdf and join them inside a unique file.

Usage:
img2pdf dir file_ext out_file

where dir is the directory that contains the images, file_ext is the extension
of those files and out_file is the name of the output pdf file. Notice that the
output file will be created inside the dir directory (unless you provide a path
relative to that directory or an absolute path).

All parameters are mandatory.
